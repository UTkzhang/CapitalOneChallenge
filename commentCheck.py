# Note: The following functions are explicitly defined for diff commenting schemes, python is inherently a bit more
# difficult to check for block vs single comments because the concept of "block" comments in python doesn't really
# exist formally, so I have chosen to define a block comment as multiple lines of consecutive comments beginning with
# a "#" in the same indentation level.

# For example
# This is a block comment
     # This is no longer a block comment (though it should never happen)
pass # This is not a part of any block comment
